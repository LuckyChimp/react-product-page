## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS for clean, easy and less CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) for touch gestures for product image preview movement on touch devices

### What I learned

I have learned to import SVG files as [ReactComponents](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-use-svgs-react/) to make them easier to use in the project. I also found out how to use reacts [useCallback](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useCallback) function to avoid too many unnecessary rerenders and optimize rendering performance.

### Useful resources

- [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) - It's the first time I worked with this library. Hammer.js ist very very simple and intuitive to work with.
